1. idea
were going to build an ... app that allows us to ...

markdown -> translate -> html
so it's a way of writing html
in an easy way without tags

--------------
Fullstack framework
--------------

markup language -> html

typescript -> javascript

rules
# -> h1
###### -> h6
####### -> p
dasdjasdkla -> p
there must be a space between # and other things and the actual
text other wise this line will be treated as a paragraph

* -> unordered list
*
* hello
world -> this will be part of the hello li to seperate it and
treat it as a seperate paragraph we need a blank line
like this:
* hello

world -> now world is a p not part of li
this is for paragraph if it was a heading
* hello
# world -> this h1 will not be part of li (don't need a blank line)

any valid html is valid markdown
